<h3>Why Learn CS?</h3>
<p>If you want to be involved in any of the STEM or digital media fields in the 
   future, you should learn CS. So, science, tech, engineering, mathematics, 
   game design, app design, software design, web design, digital art, even perhaps 
   fields like film and modeling, you should get some experience with CS.</p>
<p>CS and computers are changing every field, and it's hard to say what fields
   won't be affected by them in the near future. Some areas are much more direct,
   like engineering and science, other are less obvious, like fashion and farming.
   Regardless of your area of interest, it'd be good to have at least a little 
   background in CS, and if you're interested in anything tech or STEM related,
   then you absolutely should be taking CS.</p>
<h3>How to learn?</h3>
<p>Firstly, taking courses in school. You can start taking related classes in 
   middle school, and all the way through high school.</p>
<ul><li>7th grade: Principles of Engineering</li>
    <li>8th grade: Computer Science Fundamentals</li>
    <li>9th grade: Computer Science 1</li>
    <li>8th grade: Computer Science 2</li>
    <li>8th grade: Diploma Level Computer Science, year 1 OR Ind. Study in Tech, year 1</li>
    <li>8th grade: Diploma Level Computer Science, year 2 OR Ind. Study in Tech, year 2</li></ul>
<h3>What if I want to learn more?</h3>
<p>There are of course additional options. If you are really into tech and
   want to go into this field, I'd also recommend some self-study when on break.</p>
