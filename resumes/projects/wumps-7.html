      All projects will be more or less based on the same design and the same style
      as the initial resume they link to. Be aware, these are not fully developed
      project pages. A fully developed project page for a portfolio would have
      significantly more content, including a strong focus on planning and development.

          Creative group project in creating an illustrated storybook. Our project
          explores themes of Man vs Nature; both in humanity's lack of care for the
          environment, as well as the uprising of a hostile force that seeks to pry
          man's grip from the world.<br>

          <blockquote>
          In the not so-distant past, there were a series of commercials featuring exploding 
          hotdogs. The hotdog, often covered in toppings, was placed in the microwave, and 
          would heat until it violently exploded. How long would a hotdog need to be heated 
          before exploding, and what factors may affect this?</blockquote>

          <font size="+1" color="#653"><b><i>Methodology</i></b></font><br>
          <blockquote>
          In order to conduct this experiment, I have purchased a variety of different hotdogs 
          packages from a variety of companies. Additionally, I have also purchased a few 
          sausages as well, to see if there is any significant difference between the two as 
          well.<br><br>

          Each package of hotdogs has 8 hotdogs, and each package of sausages has 6. To maintain 
          consistency, all food products will remain in the refrigerator when not in use. 
          Starting at 1:30, hotdog/sausages of the same brand will be microwaved increasingly 
          longer by an additional 30 seconds each. <BR><BR>

          Between each test, the hotdog (or its remains) will be inspected and the inside of the 
          microwave will be cleaned. The microwave will also be allowed to rest 10 minutes between 
          each test, allowing everything to return to room temperature. <BR><BR>

          They will be supervised during the whole experiment. By doing this, I can note exactly 
          when they explode, as well as immediately stop the experiment should there be any problems.

          <font size="+1" color="#653"><b><i>Results</i></b></font><br>
          <blockquote>
          Unfortunately, the well-known commercials likely use some Hollywood trickery. Despite 
          microwaving hotdogs and sausages for more than 5 minutes, none of them explode. All of them 
          heat up to the point where the casing becomes taut, and then the casing breaks. It does not do 
          this in a dramatic fashion, but instead with just a pop and a bit of steam.<br><br>
            
          The Beddar Cheddars and sausages were slightly more eventful than the regular hotdogs, but 
          only in that when the casing breaks, they may splatter a bit of the cheese sauce and/or juices. 
          While the desired result could not be reproduced, data was collected across the brands and hotdog 
          types as to win the casing broke.<br><br>

          A more in-depth write up of the scenario, procedure, and results were presented at my school's annual 
          science fair. This included presenting all data sorted and presented in charts and tables.
