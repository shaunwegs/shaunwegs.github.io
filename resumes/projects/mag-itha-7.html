      All projects will be more or less based on the same design and the same style
      as the initial resume they link to. Be aware, these are not fully developed
      project pages. A fully developed project page for a portfolio would have
      significantly more content, including a strong focus on planning and development.

          A project to create a custom map in the Warcraft game engine based on the 
          First Battle of Ireland, according to Irish mythology. This custom scenario
          was created in a 3rd party map editing tool for Warcraft: Orcs & Humans.

          <blockquote>
          I played Warcraft 2 first, but wanted to start with the original. The sequel has
          a full map editor; the original only has a unit stats editor. Luckily, someone (BJ Pollard) has
          reverse engineered how the map files work and created an editor.
          It took a little work to getting used to the 3rd party tool, but overall it's exactly what I
          was hoping for. 
          <br><br>
          For my custom map, I wanted to recreate the Battle of Mag Itha, the first battle of Ireland.
          This story comes from Irish mythology, and in it, the ancient Irish are said to have come
          from the south and encountered the Fomorians. The Fomorians were a supernatural race seen
          as agressive and monstrous. They represent darkness, chaos, and death.
            <br><br>
          I wanted to choose a battle where one side was not human, as I wanted to design a map where
          you fight the Orcish units. It could be seen as disrespectful to use any battle that was fought
          between two human armies. I found maps of where it's believed this myth takes place, and used this as the 
          basis for the maps' geography.
            <br><br>
          In the first of the three maps, you represent Lady
          Cessair, who led the people to Ireland fleeing the coming flood. Here, you establish a 
          community before heading west. This map is based on an area south of Arklow, County Wicklow, 
          and in the territory of the Déisi.
            <br><br>
          In the second map, you represent a follower of Partholón, Ith. You travel north through an area 
          close to Dernish Island, County Sligo, a suggested location of the Fomorians island. You intend 
          to clear a plain in order to raise oxen, plough fields, and grow crops. However, you will come
          across the Fomorians as you move further northward.
            <br><br>
          The third and final map represents an area along the River Finn, near Lough Swilly in the 
          barony of Raphoe, County Donegal, where the medieval tuath of Magh Itha was. Here, you will
          battle the Fomorian forces, lead by Cichol Gricenchos "of the withered feet" in a long battle
          on the Slemna "smooth lands" (plains), which results in the end of the Fomorians.
