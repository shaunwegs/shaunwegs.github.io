      All projects will be more or less based on the same design and the same style
      as the initial resume they link to. Be aware, these are not fully developed
      project pages. A fully developed project page for a portfolio would have
      significantly more content, including a strong focus on planning and development.

          A project to create a custom campaign in the Age of Empires game engine based on the 
          First Battle of Ireland, according to Irish mythology. This custom scenario
          was created in the official editor packaged with the product.

          <blockquote>
          I wanted to choose something from mythology or pseudohistory. My first thought was to choose 
          a historical battle, as then I'll also probably be able to find maps of the area to reference. 
          However, to make a fair match between two different peoples could be challenging, and failing to
          do that, or the perception of failing to do that, could be seen as disrespectful to one of the groups.<BR><BR>
          As such, I chose to do a battle against an unknown or pseudo-unhuman force.<br>
          </blockquote><br>

          <font size="+1" color="#653"><b><i>Overview</i></b></font><br>
          <blockquote>
          For my custom map, I chose to recreate the Battle of Mag Itha, the first battle of Ireland.
          This story comes from Irish mythology, and in it, the ancient Irish are said to have come
          from the south and encountered the Fomorians. The Fomorians were seen as a supernatural race,
          or sometimes as pirates without a specific origin. This would meet my design requirement of
          not showing disrespect toward a certain culture.

          I found maps of where it's believed this myth takes place, and used this as the 
          basis for the maps' geography. The locations are approximations as the locations are
          described like <i>"an area between Lough Erne, County Fermanagh and 
          the Drowes in County Donegal. It is close to Dernish Island, County Sligo, 
          a possible location of the island of the Fomorians."</i>

          In the first of the three maps, you represent Lady
          Cessair, who led the people to Ireland fleeing the coming flood. Here, you establish a 
          community before heading west. This map is based on an area south of Arklow, County Wicklow.

          In the second map, you represent a follower of Partholón, Ith. You travel north of the Lower
          Lough Erne, toward the border of Fermanagh and Donegal. You intend 
          to clear a plain in order to raise oxen, plough fields, and grow crops. However, you will come
          across the Fomorians as you move further northward.

          The third and final map represents an area along the River Finn, near Lough Swilly in the 
          barony of Raphoe, County Donegal, where the medieval tuath of Magh Itha was. Here, you will
          battle the Fomorian forces, lead by Cichol Gricenchos "of the withered feet" in a long battle
          on the Slemna "smooth lands" (plains), which results in the end of the Fomorians.
