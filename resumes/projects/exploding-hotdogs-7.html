      All projects will be more or less based on the same design and the same style
      as the initial resume they link to. Be aware, these are not fully developed
      project pages. A fully developed project page for a portfolio would have
      significantly more content, including a strong focus on planning and development.

          <blockquote>
          In the not so-distant past, there were a series of commercials featuring exploding 
          hotdogs. The hotdog, often covered in toppings, was placed in the microwave, and 
          would heat until it violently exploded. How long would a hotdog need to be heated 
          before exploding, and what factors may affect this?</blockquote>

          <font size="+1" color="#653"><b><i>Methodology</i></b></font><br>
          <blockquote>
          In order to conduct this experiment, I have purchased a variety of different hotdogs 
          packages from a variety of companies. Additionally, I have also purchased a few 
          sausages as well, to see if there is any significant difference between the two as 
          well.<br><br>

          Each package of hotdogs has 8 hotdogs, and each package of sausages has 6. To maintain 
          consistency, all food products will remain in the refrigerator when not in use. 
          Starting at 1:30, hotdog/sausages of the same brand will be microwaved increasingly 
          longer by an additional 30 seconds each. <BR><BR>

          Between each test, the hotdog (or its remains) will be inspected and the inside of the 
          microwave will be cleaned. The microwave will also be allowed to rest 10 minutes between 
          each test, allowing everything to return to room temperature. <BR><BR>

          They will be supervised during the whole experiment. By doing this, I can note exactly 
          when they explode, as well as immediately stop the experiment should there be any problems.
