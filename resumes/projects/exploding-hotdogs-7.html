      All projects will be more or less based on the same design and the same style
      as the initial resume they link to. Be aware, these are not fully developed
      project pages. A fully developed project page for a portfolio would have
      significantly more content, including a strong focus on planning and development.

          In the not so-distant past, there were a series of commercials featuring exploding 
          hotdogs. The hotdog, often covered in toppings, was placed in the microwave, and 
          would heat until it violently exploded. How long would a hotdog need to be heated 
          before exploding, and what factors may affect this?<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <font size="+1" color="#653"><b><i>Methodology</i></b></font><br>
          In order to conduct this experiment, I have purchased a variety of different hotdogs 
          packages from a variety of companies. Additionally, I have also purchased a few 
          sausages as well, to see if there is any significant difference between the two as 
          well.<br>
