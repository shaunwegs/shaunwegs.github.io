      All projects will be more or less based on the same design and the same style
      as the initial resume they link to. Be aware, these are not fully developed
      project pages. A fully developed project page for a portfolio would have
      significantly more content, including a strong focus on planning and development.

          Creative group project in creating a fictional story told through video. Our 
          project is based around a female scientist who accidentally travels back in
          time to when the height of the Khmer Empire.

          For this project, I contributed significantly to the story concept,
          finding appropriate stills for the film, and in-camera work. I
          contributed the least to voice over.

          <blockquote>
          We created a short film about a scientist exploring the ruins of Angkor Wat. 
          She comes across a trio of radioactive rats, that coincide with an earthquake. 
          No one else feels an earthquake, and suddenly, she’s vanished. By haphazard, 
          she’s transported back in time to the height of the Khmer empire. 
          <BR><BR>
          After exploring the massive temple structure during its height, and discovering
          secrets previously lost over time, another mysterious earthquake occurs. Just
          as suddenly as she was transported to the past, she's returned to present day.
          The three radioactive rats seem like normal rats, as does everything else in
          her surroundings- it's as if she was never gone at all.

          <blockquote>
          To create our short film, we predominantly relied on still images with a few 
          built in-camera effects, music, and live audio voice overs. In camera techniques 
          included camera shake, panning, and zooming. 
          <br><br>
          The opening began with a shot of foliage. They began to shake, and are pulled 
          away to reveal a hand-made title screen. The rest of the movie predominantly
          relies on cuts between different stills from National Geographic magazines.
          We most heavily made use of an issue featuring Angkor Wat from May of 1982.

          To help the still shots have more interest, we utilized techniques similar to Ken 
          Burns in his well-known Civil War documentary from 1990. These techniques consist
          mostly of panning across, or zooming into or out of stills alongside voice over.
