      <! -- This is a Comment; you can see it in the code, but not on the page.
      
      All projects will be more or less based on the same design and the same style
      as the initial resume they link to. Be aware, these are not fully developed
      project pages. A fully developed project page for a portfolio would have
      significantly more content, including a strong focus on planning and development.

          <blockquote>
          We created a dystopian future in which humanity has continued to show no respect
          for the natural world. The world itself has seen significant climate change, and
          the world is warmer and wetter, with most of today's cities below new sea-level
          and as a result permanently flooded. 
            <br><br>
          Over time, this has resulted in a mutation of new species of capybara-type rodents 
          to gain cognitive capabilities similar to our own, the Wumpes. 
          Distraught over what has become of the world, they declare war against humanity.
          <br><br>
          The design of the Wumps is an anthropomorphic species of giant rodent, physically
          based on the Capybara of south america. In the planning of our project, we designed
          Wump military branches related to land, air, and sea combat- as well as special
          forces units. In our story, the war between Wumps and humanity has raged on
          for a while already, and most human cities are in disrepair.
            <br><br>
          The end result of our project was a hand-made and hand-illustrated picture
          book of ~30 pages in length. Each page included full page illustrations and 
          several sentences.
