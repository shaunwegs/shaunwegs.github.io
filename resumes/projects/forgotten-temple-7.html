      All projects will be more or less based on the same design and the same style
      as the initial resume they link to. Be aware, these are not fully developed
      project pages. A fully developed project page for a portfolio would have
      significantly more content, including a strong focus on planning and development.

          <blockquote>
          We created a short film about a scientist exploring the ruins of Angkor Wat. 
          She comes across a trio of radioactive rats, that coincide with an earthquake. 
          No one else feels an earthquake, and suddenly, she’s vanished. By haphazard, 
          she’s transported back in time to the height of the Khmer empire. 
          <BR><BR>
          To create our short film, we predominantly relied on still images with a few 
          built in-camera effects and live audio voice overs. In camera techniques 
          included camera shake, panning, and zooming. Panning and zooming techniques 
          used are similar to those by documentary film maker Ken Burns.
