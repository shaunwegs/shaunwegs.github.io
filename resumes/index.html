              If I were still in high school, what would my resumes look like?<br><br>
              I asked myself this question and tried to think about what I would have included 
              based on my activities at that time, as well as how I would have created one 
              using the skills I have currently developed by that point in time.<br><br>
              I started learning HTML in 7th grade, and I most likely would have used this 
              as my main tool to create my own resume. I didn't start learning any graphics 
              softwares until I'm still working on these, but perhaps they will help you.<br><br></font>

              These aren't entirely accurate yet. <br>I loved frames. I think it's a bit unfortunate 
              they died out.Somewhere in here, I'd probably have made one using the 
              webdesign style of frames. I'm not sure what the best year would be for that. I'll have 
              to think back a bit to that time period. There's also a good chance I'd have made one as
              an image using Microsoft PhotoDraw (Graphics software I learned before learning photoshop).<br><br>
              I'll have to think about this a bit more.</font>
