              If I were still in high school, <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;what would my resumes look like?<br><br>
              I asked myself this question. I tried to think about what I would have included 
              based on my activities at that time. Also, how would I have created one 
              using the skills I had at that point in time.<br><br>
              I started learning HTML in 7th grade, and I most likely would have used this 
              as my main tool to create my own resume. I'm still working on these, 
              but perhaps they will help you.

              These aren't entirely accurate yet. <br>I loved frames. I think it's a bit unfortunate 
              they died out. I'd have made probably half of these with frames. I also used learned MacroMedia
              DreamWeaver from a summer class at my local community college during summer of my 11th 
              grade year, and Microsoft FrontPage a year of two after. I likely would have used those in 12th
              grade and while at university.<br><br>
              There's also a good chance I'd have made one as an image using Microsoft PhotoDraw/Adobe Photoshop 
              or a PDF via InDesign.</p>
              I'll have to think about this a bit more.</font>
