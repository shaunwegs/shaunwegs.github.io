              If I were still in high school, what would my resumes look like?<br><br>
              I asked myself this question and tried to think about what I would have included 
                based on my activities at that time, as well as how I would have created one 
                using the skills I have currently developed by that point in time.<br><br>
                I started learning HTML in 7th grade, and I most likely would have used this 
                as my main tool to create my own resume. I didn't start learning any graphics 
                softwares until I'm still working on these, but perhaps they will help you.<br><br></font>
