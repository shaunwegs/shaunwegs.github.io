    <h1>Codex of Alchemical Engineering</h1>
    The Codex of Alchemical Engineering is a puzzle game about programming “manipulators” to move, transmute, <br>
    and bind alchemical “atoms” into complex compounds. If you’ve played SpaceChem and this sounds familiar to <br>
    you, it’s because this is the game that inspired it!
    <BR><BR>
    A few notes about the game:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>After completing a level, your progress is saved so long as your Flash “cookies” aren’t deleted. Your design, <br>
        however, is not; if you want to keep your design, you must go to the Save screen and save the text shown there (I <br>
        keep my solutions in a text file on my desktop). You can reload a saved design by pasting the design code into the <br>
        Load window and pressing the load button.</li>
      <li>The music playing is Evan LE NY’s “Rever… Peut-etre…”. Originally it played within the game itself, but as Flash <br>
        applications were disabled for the general web, it has to run in a separate HTML object. Also, all the sound effects <br>
        in the game are gone now, but the game works.</li>
    </ul>
