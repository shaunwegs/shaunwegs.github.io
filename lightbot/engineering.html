    These titles are from a fairly legendary indie puzzle game creator, Zachtronics. There's a good chance you
    aren't familiar with the name. However, you probably know at least one title their work inspired. One of their
    early games was Inifiniminer, a first-person competitive mining game that takes place in a procedurally generated 
    block world allowing players to mine, build, and explore. That may sound like something you've heard of before...
    Minecraft, perhaps? and maybe that makes it seem not so impressive... as there are quite a few Minecraft-type games now.
    Except... Infiniminer was released before Minecraft and was the inspiration for it!

    The Codex of Alchemical Engineering was meant to be a more accessible version of Manufactoid, a game about building 
    factories that the founder of Zachtronics had made in college. In Manufactoid, you must build a factory to assemble blocks into different 
    products, with each product being a separate puzzle. It’s most definitely a game for engineers, as it requires a 
    you to both think like an engineer and write Lua code to control your factory.

    <h1>Tutorial</h1>
  Zachtronics is known for making pretty complex games, and this one being from 2008 makes it one of their earlier titles. 
  The instructions for this game are not great. Please watch the tutorial below to learn how to play the game. 
  In this tutorial, I show that you can play it from the main Zachtronics website. This is no longer true, I made 
  this video before Flash was discontinued. As far as I'm aware, my page here is the only place you can play this currently.
