    <h1>Tutorial</h1>
  The instructions for this game are not great. Please watch the tutorial below to learn how to play the game. 
  In this tutorial, I show that you can play it from the main Zachtronics website. This is no longer true, I made 
  this video before Flash was discontinued. As far as I'm aware, my page here is the only place you can play this currently.
