    <h1>Boo! (A Factory Balls Game)</h1>
    A spooky version of the flash puzzle game; like in the previous games, you are shown a design, but this time for a pumpkin. Also like in the previous, your job is to recreate the design that matches the customerâ€™s order.
    This problem-solving game emphasizes logic and sequential reasoning.

    Sequencing is the most basic concept of Control Flow. Sequencing relates to the
    order in which steps are completed so the result matches the goal.
