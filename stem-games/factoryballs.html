    <h1>Codex of Alchemical Engineering</h1>
    The Codex of Alchemical Engineering is a puzzle game about programming “manipulators” to move, transmute, 
    and bind alchemical “atoms” into complex compounds. If you’ve played SpaceChem and this sounds familiar to 
    you, it’s because this is the game that inspired it!
    <BR><BR>
    A few notes about the game:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>After completing a level, your progress is saved so long as your Flash “cookies” aren’t deleted. Your design, 
        however, is not; if you want to keep your design, you must go to the Save screen and save the text shown there (I 
        keep my solutions in a text file on my desktop). You can reload a saved design by pasting the design code into the 
        Load window and pressing the load button.<br><br></li>
      <li>The music for the game is Evan LE NY’s “Rever… Peut-etre… part 1”. Originally it played within the game itself, but as Flash 
        applications were disabled for the general web, it has to run in a separate HTML object. Also, all the sound effects 
        in the game are gone now, but the game works.</li>
